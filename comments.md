# Comments

<h3>Comments and Slashes</h3>
<p>Comments are very important in your programs. They are used to tell you what something does in English, and they also are used to disable parts of your program if you need to remove them temporarily. Here's how you use comments in Java:</p>
<pre>
public class CommentsAndSlashes
{
    public static void main( String[] args )
    {
        // A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
        // Anything after the // is ignored by Java.
        System.out.println( "I could have code like this." ); // and the comment after is ignored.
        // You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
        // System.out.println("This won't run.");
        System.out.println( "This will run." );
    }
}
</pre>
<h2>What You Should Do on Your Own</h2>
<p>Assignments turned in <em>without</em> these things will not receive any points. For this exercise, try these things.</p>
<ol>
<li>Were you right about what the two slashes ('//') signify? Answer in a comment at the top of the file (above the 'public class' line).</li>
<li>Add another comment at the <em>very</em> top of the file (above your answer to the previous question) with your name and today's date.</li>
<li>* Insert a multiline comment. Do you know how to do that? Why not?</li>
</ol>
