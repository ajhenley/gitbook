# Can't get enough of Program Design, Pseudocode and Algorithms

<p>For this assignment you will&nbsp;define the problem by constructing a defining diagram, a solution algorithm using pseudocode, and a desk check of the solution algorithm using two valid test cases.</p>
<h4>Problem definition</h4>
<ul>
<li>Divide the problem into its three components: <strong>input, output, </strong>and<strong> processing</strong>.&nbsp;</li>
<li>What control structures (sequence, selection and repetition) are required?</li>
<li>What variables are required?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Solution Algorithm using pseudocode</h4>
<p>Having defined the problem and determined the required control structures, devise a solution algorithm and represent it using pseudocode.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Desk Check of your solution</h4>
<p>You need to desk check each of the algorithms with two or more test cases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>1.&nbsp;Read&nbsp;15 Fahrenheit temperatures and convert to Celsius (DOWHILE)</h4>
<p>Every day, a weather station receives 15 temperatures expressed in degrees Fahrenheit.&nbsp;A program is to be written that will accept each Fahrenheit temperature, convert it to&nbsp;Celsius and display the converted temperature to the screen. After 15 temperatures&nbsp;have been processed, the words &lsquo;All temperatures processed&rsquo; are to be displayed on the screen.</p>
<p>To compute the Celsius temperature, subtract 32 from the Fahrenheit value and then multiply by 5/9.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>2.&nbsp;Read&nbsp;15 Fahrenheit temperatures and convert to Celsius (REPEAT...UNTIL)</h4>
<p>Every day, a weather station receives 15 temperatures expressed in degrees Fahrenheit.&nbsp;A program is to be written that will accept each Fahrenheit temperature, convert it to&nbsp;Celsius and display the converted temperature to the screen. After 15 temperatures&nbsp;have been processed, the words &lsquo;All temperatures processed&rsquo; are to be displayed on&nbsp;the screen.</p>
<p><span>To compute the Celsius temperature, subtract 32 from the Fahrenheit value and then multiply by 5/9.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>3.&nbsp;Read&nbsp;15 Fahrenheit temperatures and convert to Celsius (Counted repetition)</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every day, a weather station receives 15 temperatures expressed in degrees Fahrenheit.&nbsp;A program is to be written that will accept each Fahrenheit temperature, convert it to&nbsp;Celsius and display the converted temperature to the screen. After 15 temperatures&nbsp;have been processed, the words &lsquo;All temperatures processed&rsquo; are to be displayed on&nbsp;the screen.</p>
<p><span>To compute the Celsius temperature, subtract 32 from the Fahrenheit value and then multiply by 5/9.</span></p>
