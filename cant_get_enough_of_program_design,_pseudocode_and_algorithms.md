###Can't get enough of Program Design, Pseudocode and Algorithms

####Objective
* Define the problem by constructing an algorithm using pseudocode
* Create an IPO diagram showing <strong>input, output, </strong>and<strong> processing steps</strong>
* What control structures (sequence, selection and repetition) are required?
* What variables are required?
* Show a check of your solution with test data for at least two valid test cases



####1.Receive 15 measurements (DOWHILE)
Every day, a researcher receives 15 measurements. He needs a program written that will accept each measurement and convert it to its metric equivalent. The result shall display on the monitor. After all 15 measurements are entered, the words "All measurements processed" shall be displayed on the screen.

####2. Read 15 measurements (REPEAT...UNTIL)

####3. Read 15 measurements (Counted repetition)
