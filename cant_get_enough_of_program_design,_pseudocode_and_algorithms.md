# Can't get enough of Program Design, Pseudocode and Algorithms

###Objective
* Define the problem by constructing an algorithm using pseudocode
* Create an IPO diagram showing <strong>input, output, </strong>and<strong> processing steps</strong>
* What control structures (sequence, selection and repetition) are required?
* What variables are required?
* Show a check of your solution with test data for at least two valid test cases



####1.Receive 15 Fahrenheit temperatures and convert to Celsius (DOWHILE)
Every day, a weather station receives 15 temperatures expressed in degrees Fahrenheit.&nbsp;A program is to be written that will accept each Fahrenheit temperature, convert it to&nbsp;Celsius and display the converted temperature to the screen. After 15 temperatures have been processed, the words &lsquo;All temperatures processed&rsquo; are to be displayed on the screen.

####2. Read15 Fahrenheit temperatures and convert to Celsius (REPEAT...UNTIL)

####3. Read 15 Fahrenheit temperatures and convert to Celsius (Counted repetition)
