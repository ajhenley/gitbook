# What is a defining diagram?

<h3>A Defining Diagram</h3>
<p>When defining the problem be sure you understand it clearly before you continue. This may involve asking questions or re-reading the problem statement.</p>
<p>Divide the problem into three separate components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Input &ndash; a list of the source data provided to the problem</li>
<li>Output &ndash; a list of the outputs required</li>
<li>Processing &ndash; a list of actions needed to produce the required outputs</li>
</ul>
