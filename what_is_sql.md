**SQL is a Standard - BUT....**
SQL is an ANSI (American National Standards Institute) standard computer language for accessing and manipulating database systems. SQL statements allow you to retrieve and update data in a database. SQL works with database programs like MS Access, IBM DB2, Informix, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, Sybase, etc.

**... There are many different versions of the SQL language**
Most of the SQL database programs also have their own proprietary extensions in addition to the SQL standard!

To remain in compliance with the ANSI standard each must support the major keywords in a similar manner. This means that SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT, WHERE alll work in the same way on most databases.
