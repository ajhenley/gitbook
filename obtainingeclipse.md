###Developing Java Applications with Eclipse
Eclipse is a universal IDE (a general purpose development environment). Eclipse stores your projects in a folder called a workspace. You can create multiple workspaces and switch between them however for this course we put all our projects in one workspace. If you have different clients then you may want a workspace for each client. Each workspace could contain multiple projects.

Eclipse lets you develop various types of projects. We will be developing only Java console applications which run in the terminal or Dynamic Web projects. We will also develop JUnit test projects within our existing applications. Eclipse allows you to create numerous other types of projects.

Each assignment should be completed as its own project. At the end of this course you will have a workspace containing numerous projects. Avoid the temptation to group all your work into one project. It quickly becomes unmanageable.

###Downloading Eclipse
Eclipse doesn't come with the JRE (Java Runtime Environment). You probably have Java on your computer already but if not then you should download the latest JRE from Oracle.

After you have downloaded and installed the JRE, you may then download the Eclipse IDE. You'll find the latest version of Eclipse at [https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).  

###Installing Eclipse
Installing Eclipse is simple. It just involves unzipping the downloaded file into a directory. After unzipping the Eclipse IDE is ready to run. You may wish to create a shortcut to the executable on your desktop to simplify starting Eclipse.
