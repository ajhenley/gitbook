<!--djw: done but make sure we have discussed submitting html forms, getting Parameters in the servlet first -->
###Servlet Assignment
Create a NEW Dynamic Web application. It should contain a servlet that will output a basic bootstrap web page. The web page will be a static html page called index.html. It should allow the user to enter the Fahrenheit  temperature. A form with a submit button will pass the temperature to the servlet. The servlet will calculate the Celcius temperature. The Celcius temperature will be output to a second JSP page, called output.jsp. The output JSP must also use Bootstrap to return a nicely formatted page.
