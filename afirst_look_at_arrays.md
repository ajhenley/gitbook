# A first look at arrays

An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type. The length of an array is established when the array is created. After creation, its length is fixed.

* The first item of an array has an index value of 0
* The length of an array is equal to the number of elements in the array
* The last item of an array has an index value of one less than the number of elements
* An array's length is fixed. You can change the value of the items but you can't add any new items
* All items in the array have the same data type that was declared when the array was created
