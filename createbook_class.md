###Create book class

Create a Book class that allows for Book title, author, description, price and isInStock variables. You'll start by creating the class and name it Book.

Bonus: Create a method that returns the pricing for a requested number of books. Five books at $20.00 should return $100, if they are in stock. If they are not in stock, that should be handled appropriately (hint - you decide).
