# SCOTS - Shiny College Online Transcript System

Shiny College needs to create a website for its students to view their transcripts. Create a series of pages for Shiny College students and faculty to view their information.

There needs to be at least

Transcript Page
Login Page
Student Bill Page
Instructor List
Courses taught by instructor
Current Schedule Page
These pages should be linked using the navbar to each other. 

This site is a mockup for a working application. It doesn't need to actually do anything. It is just to show what the pages will look like.

You must use Bootstrap. And Navbar. And Carousel. And Images.
