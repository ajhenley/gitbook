# Twenty questions

<p>Make a program which plays a simple game of 20 2 Questions. The first question should be "animal, vegetable, or mineral?" Then, the second question should be "is it bigger than a breadbox?" Then, display one of six possible responses, depending on their answers. You can choose what answers to give for each of the six possibilities.</p>
<p>Here's a suggestion:</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>size/type</strong></td>
<td><strong>animal</strong></td>
<td><strong>vegetable</strong></td>
<td><strong>mineral</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>smaller than a bread box</strong></td>
<td>squirrel</td>
<td>carrot</td>
<td>paper clip</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>bigger than a bread box</strong></td>
<td>moose</td>
<td>watermelon</td>
<td>Camaro</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will use nested if statements to do this.</p>
<pre>TWO QUESTIONS!
Think of an object, and I'll try to guess it.

Question 1) Is it animal, vegetable, or mineral?
&gt; animal

Question 2) Is it bigger than a breadbox?
&gt; no

My guess is that you are thinking of a mouse.
I would ask you if I'm right, but I don't actually care.
