###Super Duper Shopping Cart

The shopping cart applications are looking great! Now let's add some new features.

Once you complete the Super Shopping Cart post it to GitHub.

Now, create a branch in your project to work on the next set of features. As you finish a feature then merge the branch with the Master branch and commit your project. This way each feature is its own branch and doesn't break the master branch. Only merge to master that which is tested and works.
What to do...

    Create a branch called AcceptPayment. Then add a feature where the user can pay with a credit card and can have a shipping address and a billing address. Payments and addresses should be tracked in the database as well.
    Create a branch called StoreCredit. Then add a feature where the administrator can issue a credit to a user. For example, the administrator should be able to issue a $25.00 credit to a particular user. When that user purchases something then that user should get he $25.00 credit automatically applied to their order. So their payment amount would be discounted by the $25.00.
    Create a branch called ViewPastOrders. Then add a feature where the user can... um, ... view past orders.

How to add a branch

You do this in Eclipse with right-click then select Team | Switch To | New Branch ...

Once you create a branch you can switch to a previous branch and back again. Try that and get comfortable adding and switching between branches.

Once your branch is working then switch back to the Master branch. Then right-click and select Merge. Then select your branch name and it will be merged with Master. There is an option in Eclipse at this point to commit and that is fine. It should already be selected.

You only need to push to GitHub when you're ready to publish your repository.
