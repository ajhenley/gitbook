###Validation made Easy - er
As users input data into your program you suddenly find the need to validate it. After all, if your program is expecting a numeric quantity it wouldn't do to have the user enter a negative number or a 'Q'. That's where validation comes in. You can create your own validation class and display an error message to the user if their input is not valid. We'll want to be sure the user can only enter strings, doubles or integers.

We'll look at two ways to validate incoming data
* Use the Scanner class to ensure you only get a particular type of data
* Write your own class to validate that the data is within a specific range
