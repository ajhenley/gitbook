# More Selection Control Structures

<p>For this assignment you will&nbsp;define the problem by constructing a defining diagram, a solution algorithm using pseudocode, and a desk check of the solution algorithm using two valid test cases.</p>
<h4>Problem definition</h4>
<ul>
<li>Divide the problem into its three components: <strong>input, output, </strong>and<strong> processing</strong>.&nbsp;</li>
<li>What control structures (sequence, selection and repetition) are required?</li>
<li>What variables are required?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Solution Algorithm using pseudocode</h4>
<p>Having defined the problem and determined the required control structures, devise a solution algorithm and represent it using pseudocode.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Desk Check of your solution</h4>
<p>You need to desk check each of the algorithms with two or more test cases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4></h4>
<h4>1.&nbsp;Read three characters</h4>
<p>Design an algorithm that will prompt a terminal operator for three characters, accept&nbsp;those characters as input, sort them into acending sequence and output them to the&nbsp;screen</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>2.&nbsp;Process customer record</h4>
<p>A program is required to read a customer&rsquo;s name, a purchase amount and a tax code. <br />The tax code has been validated and will be one of the following:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 0 &nbsp;tax exempt (0%)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 1 &nbsp;state sales tax only (3%)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 2 &nbsp;federal and state sales tax (5%)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 3 &nbsp;special sales tax (7%)<br />The program must then compute the sales tax and the total amount due,and print&nbsp;the customer&rsquo;s name, purchase amount, sales tax and total amount due.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>3.&nbsp;Calculate employee's pay</h4>
<p>A program is required by a company to read an employee&rsquo;s number, pay rate and the&nbsp;number of hours worked in a week. The program is then to validate the pay rate field&nbsp;and the hours worked field and, if valid, compute the employee&rsquo;s weekly pay and then&nbsp;print it and the input data.</p>
<p>Validation: According to the company&rsquo;s rules, the maximum hours an employee can work per week is 60 hours, and the maximum hourly rate is $25.00 per hour. If the hours&nbsp;worked field or the hourly rate field is out of range, the input data and an appropriate&nbsp;message are to be printed and the employee&rsquo;s weekly pay is not to be calculated.</p>
<p>Weekly pay calculation: Weekly pay is calculated as hours worked times pay rate. If more than 35 hours are worked, payment for the overtime hours worked is calculated&nbsp;at time-and-a-half.</p>
