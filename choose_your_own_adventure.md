WELCOME TO MITCHELL'S TINY ADVENTURE!

You are in a creepy house!  Would you like to go "upstairs" or into the
"kitchen"?
> upstairs

Upstairs you see a hallway.  At the end of the hallway is the master
"bedroom".  There is also a "bathroom" off the hallway.  Where would you like
to go?
> bedroom

You are in a plush bedroom, with expensive-looking hardwood furniture.  The
bed is unmade.  In the back of the room, the closet door is ajar.  Would you
like to open the door? ("yes" or "no")
> no

Well, then I guess you'll never know what was in there.  Thanks for playing,
I'm tired of making nested if statements.
