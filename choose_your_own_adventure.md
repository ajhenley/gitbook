# Choose your own adventure!

Make a short "Choose Your Own Adventure" game. It should feature two options after the first page, two options for each of the two second-level pages, and two options for each of the four third-level pages, for a total of eight possible destinations.



WELCOME TO MITCHELL'S TINY ADVENTURE!

<pre>
You are in a creepy house!
Would you like to go upstairs or into the kitchen?
> kitchen
</pre>
<pre>
There is a long countertop with dirty dishes everywhere.  Off to one side
there is, as you'd expect, a refrigerator. You may open the "refrigerator"
or look in a "cabinet".
> refrigerator
</pre>

<pre>
Inside the refrigerator you see food and stuff.  It looks pretty nasty.
Would you like to eat some of the food? ("yes" or "no")
> no
</pre>

<pre>You die of starvation... eventually.</pre>

WELCOME TO MITCHELL'S TINY ADVENTURE!

You are in a creepy house!  Would you like to go "upstairs" or into the
"kitchen"?
> upstairs

Upstairs you see a hallway.  At the end of the hallway is the master
"bedroom".  There is also a "bathroom" off the hallway.  Where would you like
to go?
> bedroom

You are in a plush bedroom, with expensive-looking hardwood furniture.  The
bed is unmade.  In the back of the room, the closet door is ajar.  Would you
like to open the door? ("yes" or "no")
> no

Well, then I guess you'll never know what was in there.  Thanks for playing,
I'm tired of making nested if statements.
