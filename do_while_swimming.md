###The do-while loop

The do-while loop is like the while loop except the expression isn't evaluated until the loop has run at least once. A do-while loop will always run at least one time. Within the loop you need to change the value of the expression or the loop will run forever.

```java
bool run = false;
do {
    //this code would run once but that's it.
}while (run);
```
