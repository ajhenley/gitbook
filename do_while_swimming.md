The while loop is good when you don't know how many times a block of code or statement should repeat and you want to continue as long as some condition it true. It looks like this:
```java
while (expression) {
 // do you thing as long as the expression is true
}
```
The while loop will never run if the expression isn't true. So if you're reading from a file while the file is open and the file isn't open then the loop won't run. So there are lots of times when the while loop may not even run.
```java
bool run = false;
while (run){
    //this code would never run
}
```

The do-while loop is similar to the while loop except the expression isn't evaluated until the loop has run at least once.
```java
bool run = false;
do {
    //this code would run once but that's it.
}while (run);
```



###Do while swimming

So far you have only worked with one type of loop: the <code class="k">while</code> loop. But there is another type: the "do-while" loop.</p>
<p>The do-while loop works <em>almost</em> exactly like a <code class="k">while</code> loop. In fact, most of the time they are equivalent. Examine the program below to see if you can figure out the tiny difference.</p>

<h2>What You Should See</h2>
<p>Goofus and Gallant are both going swimming. They hate to swim in cold water; once the water temperature drops below 79Â°F, they stop.</p>
<p>Run the program, and type in 80.5 for the water temperature.</p>
<pre class="DOSBOX">What is the current water temperature? 80.5

Okay, so the current water temperature is 80.5F.
GALLANT approaches the lake....
        GALLANT swims for a bit. Swim time: 1 min.
        The current water temperature is now 80.0F.
        GALLANT swims for a bit. Swim time: 2 min.
        The current water temperature is now 79.5F.
        GALLANT swims for a bit. Swim time: 3 min.
        The current water temperature is now 79.0F.
        GALLANT swims for a bit. Swim time: 4 min.
        The current water temperature is now 78.5F.
GALLANT stops swimming. Total swim time: 4 min.

Okay, so the current water temperature is 80.5F.
GOOFUS  approaches the lake....
        GOOFUS  swims for a bit. Swim time: 1 min.
        The current water temperature is now 80.0F.
        GOOFUS  swims for a bit. Swim time: 2 min.
        The current water temperature is now 79.5F.
        GOOFUS  swims for a bit. Swim time: 3 min.
        The current water temperature is now 79.0F.
        GOOFUS  swims for a bit. Swim time: 4 min.
        The current water temperature is now 78.5F.
GOOFUS  stops swimming. Total swim time: 4 min.

<h2>What You Should Do on Your Own</h2>
<p>Assignments turned in <em>without</em> these things will receive no credit.</p>
<ol>
<li>Run the program, and type in 80.5 for the current water temperature. Do Goofus and Gallant swim for the same amount of time? Put your answer in a comment.</li>
<li>Run the program again, but this time enter 78 for the starting temperature. What changes?</li>
<li>Does Gallant check the water temperature first, or does he just dive right in?</li>
<li>What about Goofus? Does he check the water temperature first or just dive in?</li>
<li>What is the difference between a <code class="k">while</code> loop and a "do-while" loop?</li>
<li>One of these loops is sometimes called a "pre-test loop", and the other is called a "post-test loop". Which one is which?</li>
</ol>
