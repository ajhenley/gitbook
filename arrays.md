###Arrays
An array is a container object that allows you to use a single variable name to be associated with all instances of that variable.
* holds a fixed number of values of a single type
* Length of an array is established when the array is created
* After creation, its length is fixed

###Array processing
* Arrays are one of the most powerful programming tools available
* Provide programmer with a way of organizing and collecting of homogeneous data items
* Allow the data elements to be contained within a single variable
* Elements (items) in an array are distinguished from each other via an index or subscript
* Elements in an array can be processed with either a DO loop or DOWHILE loop
* An array is a data structure that is made up of a number of variables of all the same data type.
 

###Typical operations on arrays
* Initialize the initial values of the array elements
* Processing the elements of the array
* Searching an array for a particular element
* Writing the contents of an array to a report


###Common algorithms that manipulate arrays
* Find the sum of the elements of an array
* Find the mean (average) of the elements of an array
<li>Find the largest of the elements of an array</li>
<li>Find the smallest of the elements of an array</li>
<li>Find the range of the elements of an array</li>
</ul>

<h3>Initializing the elements of an array</h3>
<ul>
<li>Loading constant values into an array</li>
<li>Loading initial values into an array from an input file</li>
<li>Arrays of variable size</li>
<li>Paired arrays</li>
</ul>
