# Program Design Overview

Programmers need to have a good understanding of the data to be processed. This includes the data variables, constants and literals. It also includes elementary data items, data structures, files and data validation.

###Overview: Developing software solutions

####Requirements and design phase:
* Define the problem to be solved.
* Outline your solution on paper.
* Develop the outline into an algorithm.
* Test the algorithm for correctness.
* Document your solution.
####Implementation and verification phase:
* Code the algorithm into a specific programming language.
* Run the program on the computer.
* Test your program, make corrections. 
* Repeat.
####Maintenance phase:
* Document and maintain the program.

###Three different approaches to program design: 
* Procedural-driven
    * Example: C, Fortran, Basic
* object-oriented / event-driven
    * Example: Java, C#
* data-driven program design (called symbolic programming)
    * Example: LISP


##Procedural programming

##Object-oriented programming

##Symbolic programming

##Top-down development
Top-down development is an approach to software development. The designer formulates an overview of the problem. The designer then determines the necessary subsystems or components required to solve the problem. Each component is further refined in greater detail. At some point a solution emerges. Top-down development emphasizes planning. 


###Algorithm
An algorithm is a set of detailed, unambiguous and ordered instructions. An algorithm illustrates steps to convert given input into the desired output. 

###Pseudocode
Pseudocode is an English language-like way of representing the algorithm
