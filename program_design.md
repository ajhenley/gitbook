# Program Design Overview

Programmers need to have a good understanding of the data to be processed. This includes the data variables, constants and literals. It also includes elementary data items, data structures, files and data validation.

###Overview: Developing software solutions

####Planning phase:
* Define the problem to be solved.
* Outline your solution on paper.
* Develop the outline into an algorithm.
* Test the algorithm for correctness.
* Document your solution.
####Coding phase:
* Code the algorithm into a specific programming language.
* Run the program on the computer.
* Test your program, make corrections. 
* Repeat.
####Maintenance phase:
* Document and maintain the program.

###Three different approaches to program design: 
* procedure-driven
* event-driven
* data-driven program design.


##Procedural programming

##Object-oriented programming

##Top-down development

##Modular design


###Algorithm
An algorithm is a set of detailed, unambiguous and ordered instructions developed to describe the processes necessary to produce the desired output from the given input.

###Pseudocode
Pseudocode is an English language-like way of representing the algorithm

####Advantages of Pseudocode

####Conventions for Pseudocode
