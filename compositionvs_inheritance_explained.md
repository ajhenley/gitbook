###Composition vs Inheritance Explained
With Composition you learned how a Person could have a Job. Or an Education could contain schools. We called these *has-a* relationships because the first class *has-an* object of the second class.

####How is this different from inheritance?
Both composition and inheritance enable a class to reuse the code of another class. Programmers may use inheritance to get one class to contain the functionality of another. Sometimes that's the best idea in the world. Sometimes it's a square wheel. Which to use and when? The correct answer depends on the relationship between the classes.
