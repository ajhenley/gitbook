###Composition vs Inheritance Explained
With Composition you learned how a Person class could have a Job. Or an Education class could contain schools. We called these *has-a* relationships because the first class *has-an* object of the second class. The other type of relationship occurs when one class inherits another. An Employee class inherits the Person class. This type of relationship is called an *is-a* relationship. All the attributes of Person are in Employee as well as some attributes specific to Employees. Such as Department, Manager, PayRate, etc... 

####How is this different from inheritance?
Both composition and inheritance enable a class to reuse the code of another class. Programmers may use inheritance to get one class to contain the functionality of another. Sometimes that's the best idea in the world. Sometimes it's a square wheel. Which to use and when? The correct answer depends on the relationship between the classes.
