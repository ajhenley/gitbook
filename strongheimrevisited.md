# Strongheim Revisited

It seems that Strongheim can't easily compute GPAs accurately. Modify the previous application to store the relative weights of the different types of assignments in a database table.This should allow the professor to change the weights at will and then recompute the grades of his students.

As long as you are making changes, also modify the application to handle multiple classes of students. The problem is some of the students in Strongheim's 9:30 Earth Science class are also in his 1pm Intro to Physics class. We need to make sure not to mix the grades between those two classes.
