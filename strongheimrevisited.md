###Strongheim Revisited
It seems that Strongheim can't easily compute GPAs accurately. Modify the previous application. The professor needs to store the relative weights of the different types of assignments in a database table. This should allow him to change the weights at will and then recompute the grades of his students.

As long as you're making changes allow the application to handle multiple classes of students. Some students in Strongheim's 9:30 Earth Science class are also in his 1 pm Intro to Physics class. You need to ensure you don't mix the grades between those two classes.
