Bullhorn is new startup with an old idea. They want to create a microblogging platform. There should be a limited number of characters per post - say 141. Yes, just like Twitter. But one better.

####Your assignment
You're hired! Welcome, Employee #2! Your task is to create a Dynamic Web Application, a NEW UNIQUE Dynamic Web Application. If you add this to an existing project a kitten on YouTube will cry. The name of your application is Bullhorn. It will include a form allowing a person to enter a new post. The input box should limit all posts to 141 characters. Also create a page that lists all the posts made. List them in reverse chronological order. And make it look nice.
 * Use JPA to connect to the database.
 * Use Bootstrap to make the application attractive.
