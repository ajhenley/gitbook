# Bullhorn Assignment #1

Bullhorn is new startup with an old idea: create a microblogging platform with a limited number of characters per post - say 140. Yes, just like twitter.

Your task is to create a Dynamic Web Application, a NEW UNIQUE Dynamic Web Application that includes a form allowing a person to enter a new post and a page that lists all the posts made (attractively) in reverse chronological order.

You must use JPA to connect to the database.

Use Bootstrap to make the application attractive.
