###Bullhorn Assignment #1

Bullhorn is new startup with an old idea: create a microblogging platform with a limited number of characters per post - say 141. Yes, just like Twitter. But one better.

####Your assignment
You have been hired as employee #2. Your task is to create a Dynamic Web Application, a NEW UNIQUE Dynamic Web Application. If you add this to an existing project a kitten will cry. Your application will be called Bullhorn. It will include a form allowing a person to enter a new post. The input box should limit all  posts to 141 characters. Also create a page that lists all the posts made. List them in reverse chronological order. And make it look nice.

You must use JPA to connect to the database.

Use Bootstrap to make the application attractive.
