###Line item invoice assignment
Create an application that allows users to create an invoice application.

THIS APPLICATION SHOULD USE MULTIPLE CLASSES.

Users should be able to input data until they run out and then the application will print out an invoice of all the data including a subtotal, tax and grand total.

Bonus: Add an extra field to the inputs (untaxable). This value will be inputted as either true or false. This will affect whether tax will be charged on that item or not. The invoice should now have:

```
taxable subtotal: 1000
untaxable subtotal: 100
tax: 90
Grand Total: 1190
```
