<p>The first commit can be a README file with as little as one line summary of the project, or enough information about the project's first milestone. The broad topics can also include:<br /> &nbsp;- Introduction<br /> - Project description<br /> - Project structure<br /> - Coding conventions</p>

<p>git init</p>
</td>
<td width="365">
<p>The git init command creates a new Git repository. It can be used to convert an existing, un-versioned project to a Git repository or initialize a new empty repository. This is the first command you&rsquo;ll run in a new project.<br /> <br /> git init creates a .git subdirectory in your project directory which all of the information git needs for your repository. The rest of an existing project is unchanged.</p>
