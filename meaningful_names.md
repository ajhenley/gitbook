# Naming Conventions

When designing a solution algorithm the programmer will introduce some unique names to be used to represent the variables or objects in the problem. All names should be meaningful. A name given to a variable is simply a method of identifying a particular storage location in the computer.

The uniqueness of a name will differentiate this location from others. Often a name describes the type of data stored in a particular variable. For instance, a variable may be one of three simple data types: an integer, a real number or a character. The name itself should be transparent enough to adequately describe the variable; for example, number1, number2 and number3 are more meaningful names for three numbers than A, B and C. But taxRate, income, and nmbrDependents are more meaningful still.

If more than one word is used in the name of a variable, then underscores are useful as word separators, for example sales_tax and word_count. If an underscore is not desirable, then words can be joined together with the use of a capital letter as a word separator, for example salesTax and wordCount. The latter is more common and is known as Camel Case.

Most programming languages do not tolerate a space in a variable name, as a space would signal the end of the variable name and thus imply that there were two variables. 

For readability, it is not advisable to string together words all in lower case. A name such as ‘carregistration’ is much harder to read than
‘carRegistration’.

Naming Conventions
A well-written program should be self-documenting. Naming conventions make programs more understandable by making them easier to read.  They can also give information about the function of the identifier-for example, whether it's a constant, package, or class-which can be helpful in understanding the code.
