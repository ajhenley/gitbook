On GitHub, you can store all kinds of projects in&nbsp;<i><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary">repositories</a></i>. Personal repositories belong to&nbsp;<i>user accounts</i>, so after you've&nbsp;<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account">signed up for GitHub</a>, you can create your first repository.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;<i>fork</i>&nbsp;is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. Forks are commonly used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.</p>
<p>One of the great features on GitHub is the ability to see what other people are working on and who they are connecting with. You can follow people on GitHub and watch projects.</p>
