###Gift Advisor

Everybody wants to give a unique gift that will be remembered year-round. Yet, when that special occasion comes around our minds go blank and we forget what our recipients want. Thus we end up giving ties, scarves and candles that eventually get re-gifted.

Your task is to develop a program that will prompt the user for the recipient's gender and age. You'll also ask for the giver's price range. Use high, medium or low.

Now write a program that will select the perfect gift based on the table below. Feel free to modify the gift list if you wish.
