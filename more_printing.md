<h2>Frequently-Asked Questions</h2>
<h6>Does my letter have to look exactly like yours?</h6>
<p>No, but it does have to look roughly like a letter, including the box around the outside and the stamp.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<h6>Do I have to use my real address?</h6>
<p>Of course not. But make sure your fake address takes up three lines.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<h6>How to I get a | to show up on the screen?</h6>
<p>The | character is called a "pipe". Assuming you are using a normal US keyboard, it is Shift + backslash (\). The backslash key is usually located between the Backspace and Enter keys.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<h6>Why doesn't my letter line up when I run the program?!? Everything looks perfect in the code!</h6>
<p>You probably used a mixture of tabs and spaces between the quotes in your println() statements. Many text editors / IDEs will only move the cursor 4 spaces when you press TAB. But when your program runs, any tabs embedded inside the quotes will take up 8 spaces, not 4. If you delete ALL the tabs between the quotes and replace them with spaces, things should look the same in your code and when you run the program.</p>
