<!--
todo: have user create a program that prompts for words and saves those words to a variable and remembers the history of the variable. Then use a reverse for loop to print the words to the console in order the user entered them. Print the history whenever the user types the word History, otherwise save the word that is entered.

Storing the history of objects in a program is a common task. Maintaining the history of an object in a program has traditionally required programmers either to write specific code for handling the historical data, or to use a library which supports history logging.

History variables are variables in a programming language which store not only their current value, but also the values they have contained in the past. Some existing languages do provide support for history variables. However these languages typically have many limits and restrictions on use of history variables.
