###Pair Assignment Part Deux
Again, work with your partner for this assignment. Plan out your strategy before you make changes to your database. It's a good idea to back up your database before working on it. You can run scripts from within SQL Developer.

As it turns out, Java Bank has new requirements for their banking app. (Users always have additional requirements).

They need you to add the following features to your application:
* Customers should be able to transfer money between their accounts
    * Customers should be able to have multiple accounts (up to 1 savings and 1 checking account)
    * Customers should have overdrafts on their checking account to be automatically paid out of their savings account. There will be a $15 instant transfer fee for this service.
