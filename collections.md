### Overview of Collections
The Java Collections API are a set of classes and interfaces. They make it easy to work with collections of objects. They work like arrays with superpowers. Their size can change dynamically, and they have more advanced behavior than arrays.

Collections come in four basic flavors:
* **Lists** contain lists of things
* **Sets** contain unique things
* **Maps** contain unique ID for each thing
* **Queues** contains things arranged in the order they are to be processed
