###The Difference Between CSS and HTML

####CSS -> Style & Formatting
#####Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) define the look and feel
Font size, font color, font type, styling around images, page layout, mouse-over effects and more are all determined by CSS.

####HTML -> Structured Content
#####HyperText Markup Language(HTML) creates the structure
HTML allows you to put images, text, videos, forms and other pieces of content together into a cohesive webpage. 

####Viewing Source
To view the html of a web page, right-click and select View Source. Look for the style sheet link in the head section of your page. You can browse to the style sheet and view that as well. You can even link that style sheet to your page.

Style sheets can be found in one of three places: In the page, in the tag or in the link.

####Your assignment
Create a style sheet to show the ```<h1>``` tag as blue and the background as some other color.
