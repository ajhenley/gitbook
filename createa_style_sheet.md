The Difference Between CSS and HTML

CSS = Style: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) dictate your websiteâ€™s look and feel.

Font size, font color, font type, styling around images, page layout, mouse-over effects and more are all determined by CSS.


HTML = Content: HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the building-blocks of web pages.

HTML allows you to put images, text, videos, forms and other pieces of content together into a cohesive webpage. You can also tweak text words, resize images, and add links to either.

To view the html of a web page, right-click and select View Source. Look for the style sheet link in the head section of your page. You can browse to the style sheet and view that as well. You can even link that style sheet to your page.

 

Your page can find it's style in one of three places: In the page, in the tag or in the link.
