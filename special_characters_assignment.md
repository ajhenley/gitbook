###Special characters assignment

Sadly, this application doesn't work... but you're the person who can fix it.

{%ace edit=false, lang='java'%}
public class SpecialCharacterProgram {
    String message1, message2;
    
    message1 = \/\/\/\/\/\r\t\b
    message2 = ";
    
    System.out.println(message1 + message2);
            
}
{%endace%}

This is more difficult than you think unless you work through it methodically. 
Fix the variables message1 and message2 so the program prints the following:

```
message1 = \/\/\/\/\/\r\t\b
message2 = ";
```

You should not add any new lines of code. In other words, do not add additional System.out.println() statements. You can do it. The world believes in you!
