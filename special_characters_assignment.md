# Special characters assignment

This application doesn't work...

```java
public class SpecialCharacterProgram {
    String message1, message2;
    
    message1 = He said: "1/2 of 1/3 is 1/6th";
    message2 = She said: "I found it online at 'http://www.somesite.com/index.jsp'";
    
    System.out.println(message1 + message2);
            
}
```
This is more difficult than you think. Work through it little by little. 
Fix the program so it prints the following:
```
He said: "1/2 of 1/3 is 1/6th"
She said" "I found it online at 'http://www.somesite.com/index.jsp'"
```
You may not add any new lines of code. In other words, do not add additional System.out.println() statements. You can do it. I believe in you!
