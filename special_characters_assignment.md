# Special characters assignment

This application doesn't work...

```java
public class SpecialCharacterProgram {
    String message1, message2;
    
    message1 = \/\/\/\/\/\r\t\b";
    message2 = ";
    
    System.out.println(message1 + message2);
            
}
```
This is more difficult than you think unless you work through it methodically. 
Fix the program so it prints the following:
```
message1 = "\/\/\/\/\/\r\t\b"
message2 = ";
```
You may not add any new lines of code. In other words, do not add additional System.out.println() statements. You can do it. I believe in you!
