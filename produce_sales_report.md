# Produce Sales Report

###Objective
* Define the problem by constructing an algorithm using pseudocode
* Create an IPO diagram showing <strong>input, output, </strong>and<strong> processing steps</strong>
* What control structures (sequence, selection and repetition) are required?
* What variables are required?
* Show a check of your solution with test data for at least two valid test cases
* 

<p>&nbsp;Design a program that will read a file of sales records and produce a sales report. Each&nbsp;record in the file contains a customer&rsquo;s number and name, a sales amount and a tax&nbsp;code. The tax code is to be applied to the sales amount to determine the sales tax due&nbsp;for that sale, as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<table border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Tax Code</td>
<td>Sales Tax</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>tax exempt</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>3%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>5%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><br /><br />The report is to print a heading "SALES REPORT", and detail lines listing the customer number, name, sales amount, sales tax and the total amount owed.</p>
