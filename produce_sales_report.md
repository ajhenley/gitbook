# Produce Sales Report

<p>For this assignment you will&nbsp;define the problem by constructing a defining diagram, a solution algorithm using pseudocode, and a desk check of the solution algorithm using two valid test cases.</p>
<h4>Problem definition</h4>
<ul>
<li>Divide the problem into its three components: <strong>input, output, </strong>and<strong> processing</strong>.&nbsp;</li>
<li>What control structures (sequence, selection and repetition) are required?</li>
<li>What variables are required?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Solution Algorithm using pseudocode</h4>
<p>Having defined the problem and determined the required control structures, devise a solution algorithm and represent it using pseudocode.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Desk Check of your solution</h4>
<p>You need to desk check each of the algorithms with two or more test cases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Design a program that will read a file of sales records and produce a sales report. Each&nbsp;record in the file contains a customer&rsquo;s number and name, a sales amount and a tax&nbsp;code. The tax code is to be applied to the sales amount to determine the sales tax due&nbsp;for that sale, as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<table border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Tax Code</td>
<td>Sales Tax</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>tax exempt</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>3%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>5%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><br /><br />The report is to print a heading "SALES REPORT", and detail lines listing the customer number, name, sales amount, sales tax and the total amount owed.</p>
