####Objective
* Define the problem by constructing an algorithm using pseudocode
* Create an IPO diagram showing <strong>input, output, </strong>and<strong> processing steps</strong>
* What control structures (sequence, selection and repetition) are required?
* What variables are required?
* Show a check of your solution with test data for at least two valid test cases

Design a program that will read a file of sales records and produce a sales report. Each record in the file contains a customer's number and name, a sales amount and a tax code. The tax code is to be applied to the sales amount to determine the sales tax due for that sale, as follows:
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<table border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Tax Code</td>
<td>Sales Tax</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>tax exempt</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>3%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>5%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The report must print a heading, "Sales Report", followed by detail lines. Each detail line must list the customer number, name, sales amount, sales tax and the total amount due.
