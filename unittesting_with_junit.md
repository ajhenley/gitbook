###Unit Testing with JUnit

Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process. TDD starts with an (initially failing) automated test case. This test case is a Java method which defines a desired improvement or new function. Next, the minimum amount of code is written to pass that test. Finally, the code is refactored to meet acceptable standards. 

>"Test-driven development encourages simple designs and inspires confidence".
   - Kent Beck, credited with having developed or 'rediscovered' the technique

A 2005 study found that using TDD meant writing more tests. Programmers who wrote more tests tended to be more productive. <br/>
