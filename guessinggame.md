# Guessing game

<h3>Keep Guessing</h3>

<p>Create a number-guessing game so that users can guess <strong>until</strong> they get the number right. That means
it will keep looping as long as the guess is different from the secret number.
Use a <code class="k">while</code> loop.</p>

<p>The output should look something like this:</p>
<pre class="DOSBOX">I have chosen a number between 1 and 10. Try to guess it.
Your guess: 5
That is incorrect. Guess again.
Your guess: 4
That is incorrect. Guess again.
Your guess: 8
That is incorrect. Guess again.
Your guess: 6
That's right! You're a good guesser.
