###Create the rainfall calculator

Create a new project in Eclipse called Rainfall calculator. This will be a console application like those you've looked at so far.

Use your algorithm for calculating the amount of rainfall that runs off a roof. Prompt the user to enter the length and width of the roof along with any other variables you need.
