###Create a Form Processing Servlet
You've successfully created an HTML form. It looks great. It does nothing. Let's change that. We need to get the data from your form to your servlet.

Have you read the page called *Get and Post Details*? It explains how this works.

####Your assignment
1. For the form's action attribute you'll enter the name specified in your servlet's @WebServlet attribute.
2. Create a servlet called ProcessSubscriptions.java. The servlet will retrieve the parameters from the form. It will then display them on a page called confirm.jsp.

####Your form may use any of the following HTML form elements:
{%ace edit=false, lang='html'%}
<form> Defines an HTML form for user input. Be sure to set the action attribute to your servlet's ```@WebServlet``` annotation 
<input> Defines an input control. It must have a type attribute. And a name attribute. 
<textarea> Defines a multiline input control (text area)
<label> Defines a label for an <input> element
<select> Defines a drop-down list
<optgroup> Defines a group of related options in a drop-down list
<option> Defines an option in a drop-down list
<submit>Defines a form submit button
