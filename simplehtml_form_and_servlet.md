###Simple HTML Form and Servlet

It's time for you to bravely walk through the creation of an html form and servlet.
Read the page called *Get and Post Details* for additional information.

####Your assignment
1. Create a new dynamic web project. 
2. Add a page called index.html. On that page create an HTML Form.
3. For the form's action attribute you'll enter the name of your servlet.
4. Create a servlet called ProcessForm. The servlet should retrieve the parameters from the form and display them on a page called output.jsp.

**DO NOT USE BOOTSTRAP**. You do not get points for beauty. Functionality is important here. The sole purpose of this project is to have you create a minimal servlet/form processor, not a fancy website.

####Your form MUST use each of the following HTML form elements:
```html
<form> Defines an HTML form for user input
<input> Defines an input control
<textarea> Defines a multiline input control (text area)
<label> Defines a label for an <input> element
<select> Defines a drop-down list
<optgroup> Defines a group of related options in a drop-down list
<option> Defines an option in a drop-down list
<submit>Defines a form submit button
<button> Defines a clickable button
```
