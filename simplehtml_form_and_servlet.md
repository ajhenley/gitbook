# Simple HTML Form and Servlet

Create a new dynamic web project. Add a page called index.html. On that page create an HTML Form.

Refer to the following documentation at w3schools.com (Links to an external site.) if you need information about creating a form.

Read the post about Get and Post details for additional information.

For the form's action attribute you'll put the name of your servlet.

Create a servlet called ProcessForm.

The servlet should retrieve the parameters from the form and display them on a page called output.jsp.

DO NOT USE BOOTSTRAP. You do not get points for beauty. Functionality is important here. The sole purpose of this project is to have you create a minimal servlet/form processor, not a fancy website.

Your form MUST use each of the following HTML form elements:

<form> Defines an HTML form for user input
<input> Defines an input control
<textarea> Defines a multiline input control (text area)
<label> Defines a label for an <input> element
<select> Defines a drop-down list
<optgroup> Defines a group of related options in a drop-down list
<option> Defines an option in a drop-down list
<submit>Defines a form submit button
<button> Defines a clickable button
