# Program Design

When developing a new program the first thing a programmer should reach for is a pencil. Good programming starts with planning. In fact, you shouldn't code until you know what you're developing. Following this rule will save you hours of rework. Surprisingly, it will also set you apart from your lesser colleagues. Don't follow their lead. Learn to be a planner.

<blockquote>“If you fail to plan, you are planning to fail!”
 - Benjamin Franklin</blockquote>
