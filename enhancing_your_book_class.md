###Enhancing your book class
The Book class already contains private member variables and a default constructor. It also contains getters and setters for each private member variable.

Next, you'll add an overloaded constructor and a method.

An overloaded constructor is a constructor that takes one or more parameters. Create one that takes an SKU and returns the appropriate book object.

Next, create a method called getDisplayText(). It takes no parameters. When called it returns a string containing the author, title and description. You'll use this method to print your book information to the console.
