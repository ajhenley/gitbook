###A basic web page

Create a basic web page with a title and a header tag that both say, "Hello World!"

All well-designed HTML pages meets HTML5 standards. This means it has the basic structure shown below. The ```<!DOCTYPE>``` declaration the first thing in your HTML document. The ```<!DOCTYPE>``` declaration is not actually an HTML tag but rather an instruction to the  browser.

Every tag must have a corresponding closing tag. Sometimes you'll see tags that open and close with two tags, ```<p>...</p>``` and sometimes with just one, ```<br/>```. Both forms are correct. The latter form has no content. It simply tells the browser to insert a line break at that spot.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>Dalton Used Car Emporium</title>
</head>

<body>
<p>Hello, World!</p>
</body>

</html>
```
