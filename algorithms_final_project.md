# Algorithms Final Project

Go to Amazon or another site of your choosing.

Go through the process of purchasing a book.

Write down the steps.

Only consider one path.

When you create the algorithm for the purchase then any other person should be able to complete the same purchase by following your steps and not thinking about what they are doing.

Would it be possible to automate the purchase by writing a program that follows the same steps? 
If not, change your algorithm.



Bonus: Choose one of the following and write an algorithm for it:
1. Solving a Sudoku puzzle
2. Solving a Rubik's cube
3. Finding a word in a dictionary (not online dictionary... the paper kind)
4. Printing a copy of an article about you online and mailing that copy to your Grandma who doesn't have a computer.
