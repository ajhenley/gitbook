# Algorithms Final Project

You've just been hired by Alton's Hardware Store. Your job is to develop a tool which will allow his customers to calculate the cost for installing a fence. First you need to determine the algorithm to calculate the cost of installing the fence. 

Go to http://bit.ly/FenceCost
This link should direct you to a fence cost calculator.


Your algorithm should allow any other person to achieve the same result by following your steps. They should not have to think about what they are doing.

Would it be possible to automate the calculation by writing a program that follows the same steps? If not, change your algorithm.

Bonus (if you're finished early): Choose one of the following and write an algorithm for it:
1. Solving a Sudoku puzzle
2. Solving a Rubik's cube
3. Finding a word in a dictionary (not online dictionary... the paper kind)
4. Printing a copy of an article about you online and mailing that copy to your Grandma who doesn't have a computer.
5. Opening a document in Microsoft Word and searching for all instances of a word and replacing with another word.
