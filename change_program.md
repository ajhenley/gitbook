# Change program

<p>By now, you should be comfortable with both writing programs and debugging programs (making a broken program work). This is a new type of assignment. Here we want to take a working program and change it to do something else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre>public class ChangeProgram {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int x, y, z;
		
		x = 5;
		y = 9;
		
		z = x * y;

		System.out.println("The product is " + z);
	}
}</pre>
<p>Change this program to output the product of 5 and 8.75.</p>
