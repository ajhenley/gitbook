###What is the JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library (JSTL)?

>JSTL extends the JSP specification by adding a tag library of JSP tags for common tasks such as conditional execution, loops and internationalization.

The JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library (JSTL) is a collection of four custom-tag libraries which extend the JSP specification. The JSTL is a component of the Java EE Web application development platform. 

####Usage of JSTL 1.1
As for the use of  JSTL 1.1 the JSP-EL  is required, a servlet-container has to be conform to at least  the JSP-2.0 specifications in order to be be used on this. The reference implimentation is made up of two JAR – archives **standard.jar** and **jstl.jar**. In most containers  they usually need to be located in the lib-path of the web application only. To ensure  backwards compatibility the JSTL 1.1 is referenced by the URI *http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/fmt*  whereas *http://java.sun.com/jstl/fmt*  is used for JSTL 1.0.

####Example JSP-page in XML-notation (JSPX):

{%ace edit=false, lang='html'%}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<jsp:root
  xmlns:jsp="http://java.sun.com/JSP/Page"
  xmlns:c="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core"
  xmlns:fmt="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/fmt"
version="2.0">

<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en">
<head>
  <title>JSTL 1.1</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Iteration</h1>
<ul>
  <c:forEach var="num" begin="1" end="10">
    <li>Number<c:out value="${num}"/></li>
  </c:forEach>
</ul>

<h1>Formatting</h1>
<p>
  Currency: <fmt:formatNumber value="10000" type="currency" currencyCode="EUR" />
</p>

</body>
</html>
</jsp:root>
{%endace%}

####Code-Explanations:

In the ```jsp:root``` – element the usage of the basis- und the I18N-Taglibs (core and fmt) from the JSTL is indicated and linked to the according XML-namespace. Under the headline ''Iteration'' the ''forEach-Tag'' from the core-library is used:  It displays the tag-body (i.e., the content of the Tag) ten times.  In this loop with ''<code>${num}</code>'' you can find JSP – Expression.  With every loop cycle the current data from ''num'' is displayed here. Under the headline ''Formatting'' the ''formatNumber''-tag from the fmt – library of JSTL is used. Depending on the adjusted lanuage (this can be set by fmt:setLocale for example) the number 10000 will be formated (e.g. in german as „EUR 10.000,00“ and in english as „EUR 10,000.00“)
