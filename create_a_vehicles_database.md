###Create a vehicles database
Now it's your turn. Create a database to store information about people and their vehicles.
First, create a table for people. You've already seen this so it should be simple.
Next, create a table for vehicles. The vehicles should contain the same attributes as were used in the class for vehicles.
Finally, create a table for specific vehicles such as airplanes, cars, and boats.
Now populate the tables. 
Then query the tables to show the people who own the   cars.
