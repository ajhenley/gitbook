The Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) specificatin describes how webservers can interact with all Java web technologies. 

The technologies we use in this course include:
* Servlets
* JavaServer Pages (JSP)
* Java Persistence API (JPA) and Java Persistence Query Langauge (JPQL)
* Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB)
* Oracle Database
* HTML, CSS and JavaScript

In your web applications you will be creating servlets and JavaServer Pages (JSP). The role of the servlets is to perform the server-side processing. The JSPs store the HTML and present the user interface through the browser. THe JSPs will contain Expression Langage and tags which the controller (a servlet) can use to populate the JSP with data. Often the data comes from a database. We will be using Oracle in this book.
