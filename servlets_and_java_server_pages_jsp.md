In your web applications you will be creating servlets and JavaServer Pages (JSP). The role of the servlets is to perform the server-side processing. The JSPs store the HTML and present the user interface through the browser. THe JSPs will contain Expression Langage and Tags which the servlet can use to populate the JSP with data. Often the data comes from a database.
