###Gulp! Assignment
You are hired by a new start-up to help them write their application, Gulp! (think Yelp! without pictures or maps).

You need to write an application that allows users to rate and/or review their favorite restaurants. 
Each should provide functionality to do the following:
* Rate a restaurant on a scale of 0-5 stars
* Write a review of a restaurant. Each review should include not only the rating but also the date reviewed.
* View a restaurant and see the average rating, number of ratings and a list of all the reviews. Also should list the name, address and description of the restaurant.
* Allow a user to create a profile including their: name, email and ZIP. The profile page should list all the ratings and reviews made by that user.
* List restaurants by the average rating.
* Your application should allow a user to enter only one review for any particular restaurant. 
* A restaurant can can have any number of reviews. A user can review any number of restaurants.
* Your data must include at least three users, five restaurants and twelve reviews.


####DESIGN BEFORE YOU CODE 
You need to talk about everything you want to do before you do it. You might even want to sketch it out before you proceed.
