# Gulp! Assignment
<p>You are hired by a new startup to help them write their application, Gulp! (think Yelp! without pictures or maps).</p>
<p>You need to write an application that allows users to rate and/or review their favorite restaurants. Each should provide functionality to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rate a restaurant on a scale of 0-5 stars</li>
<li>Write a review of a restaurant. Each review should include not only the rating but also the date reviewed.</li>
<li>View a restaurant and see the average ratiing, number of ratings and a list of all the reviews. Also should list the name, address and description of the restaurant.</li>
<li>Allow a user to create a profile including their: name, email and zipcode. The profile page should list all the ratings and reviews made by that user.</li>
<li>List restaurants by the average rating.</li>
<li>Your application should allow a user to enter only one review for any particular restaurant. A restaurant can can have any number of reviews. A user can review any number of restaurants.</li>
<li>Your data must include at least three users, five restaurants and twelve&nbsp;reviews.</li>
</ul>
<p>DESIGN BEFORE YOU CODE. You need to talk about everything you want to do before you do it. You might even want to sketch it out before you proceed.</p>
