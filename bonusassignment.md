###Bonus assignment

In this assignment you will write a program to implement the bubble sort. We saw the bubble sort in the algorithm's section but here is the pseudo code for it. Your task is to prompt the user for a word. Use the last names of the presidents. Save the list to a file. Next, read the file into an array and use the bubble sort algorithm to sort the file. Finally, print the sorted file to the screen.


``` 
    For i = 0 to n - 1
        For j = 1 to n - 1
            If (a(j) > a(j + 1))
                temp = a(j)
                a(j) = a(j + 1)
                a(j + 1) = temp
            End-If
        End-For
    End-For
```
