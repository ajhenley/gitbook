###Bonus assignment

Use the information from the assignment at Reading and Writing to a File to make your Zork assignment save it's history from a file. And also read the history from the file when it starts. So you will have an endless history.

Your history file should contain a list of questions and answers.

Secondly, if the user asks the same question again then be sure you give them the same response.
