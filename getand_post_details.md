###What happens when you submit a form?

The example application below consists of l show you the results of submitting a form via Get and via Post. The index page contains two forms. The only difference between the two forms is one sends its data via get and the other via post. Open this project in Eclipse. Once you run it you will get a better understanding of Get and Post and the Request object which comes from the browser. 

The GET method sends form information via the URL. When using the GET method the 3rd section of the request packet, the request body, remains empty.

The POST method is used when you create an HTML form, and request method=POST as part of the tag. The POST method allows the client to send form data to the server in the request body section of the request. The data is encoded and is formatted similar to the GET method. The data is sent to the server via standard input.
