###Object-Orientation
What is a class and what is object-oriented programming?

We've created a class. Let's look at the big picture. We'd like to get a sense of the profound impact object-oriented programming has had on software development.

First there was functional or top-down programming. All programs had a single entry point and worked their way down, line by line, to a single exit point. They could jump around with various routines and go-to statements but all code was basically one large file. And it got cumbersome.

Division of labor
Somehow the idea emerged that you could have a programmer develop code in units or blocks or what is now known as classes. And these classes could be developed simultaneously and put together in a larger program. And re-used in other programs. And tested independently. Once tested they wouldn't have to be tested again.
