###Professor Strongheim's Gradebook Assignment
The hapless yet affable Professor Strongheim needs help. And you happened to be walking down the hall just now. He lost his paper gradebook and his department chair has demanded that he moves his grading to an electronic means.

Build an application that records the Student ID, Assignment name, type (homework, quiz, test, or project), date and grade (0-100).

The application should store this data in a database and allow the user to view the following:
* All assignments by a student
* All assignments of a particular type by anyone
* All assignments of a particular type by a particular student
* The average for a student
* The average for a student by assignment type
* The highest and lowest grade for a particular assignment type (highest quiz grade, lowest project grade, etc)
