# Another Modularization Activity

A student at Java University can only get a scholarship if they received a 3.0 on a 4.0 scale the previous semester. Create a modularized algorithm for handling the entry of a student's grades, computing their gpa, determining their eligibility and outputting either "Congrats!" or "Aw fudgewickets!".
