####Objective
* Define the problem by constructing an algorithm using pseudocode
* Create an IPO diagram showing <strong>input, output, </strong>and<strong> processing steps</strong>
* What control structures (sequence, selection and repetition) are required?
* What variables are required?
* Show a check of your solution with test data for at least two valid test cases


####Create a modularized solution
A student at Java University can only get a scholarship if they received a 3.0 on a 4.0 scale the previous semester. 

Create a modularized algorithm for handling the entry of a student's grades, computing their GPA, determining their eligibility and outputting either "Congrats!" or "Aw... fudgewickets!".
