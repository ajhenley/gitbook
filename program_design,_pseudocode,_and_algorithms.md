# Program Design, Pseudocode, and Algorithms

###Objective
* Define the problem by constructing an algorithm using pseudocode
* Create an IPO diagram
* Show a check of your solution with test data for at least two valid test cases
* 
###Problem definition
* Divide the problem into its three components: <strong>input, output, </strong>and<strong> processing</strong>
* What control structures (sequence, selection and repetition) are required?
* What variables are required?


####1. Create a basic application
Your 6 year old client needs an application that will receive an integer from the user banging on the keyboard, add 5 to it, double it, subtract 7 from it, and display the result to the screen.

####2. Add three numbers and print the total
His little sister now wants a program to read three numbers, add them together and print their total.

####3. Find the average score
A program is needed to prompt the user operator for ten exam scores from a class and calculate and display to the screen the average score, calculated as the sum of the scores divided by the number of scores.

####4. How much water runs off the roof
You may be as astonished as we were to learn how much water runs off a roof in a rain storm!
Take a guess--what is the volume of water that runs off a 1,000 square foot roof during a 1" rain storm?
20 gallons? 50 gallons? 100 gallons? 1000 gallons?

To calculate the runoff from any given rainfall:
Take the dimensions of the footprint of your roof and convert them to inches. (So, a 50' x 20' roof is 600" x 240".)
Multiply the roof dimensions by the number of inches of rainfall. 
In this example, 600" x 240" x 1" = 144,000 cubic inches of water.
Divide by 231 to get the number of gallons (because 1 gallon = 231 cubic inches). (144,000/231 = 623.38).

Write the pseudocode for the above problem. If you use the numbers provided in the example then the correct pseudocode will calculate the same result.
