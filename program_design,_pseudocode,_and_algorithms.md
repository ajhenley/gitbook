# Program Design, Pseudocode, and Algorithms

<p>For this assignment you will&nbsp;define the problem by constructing a defining diagram, a solution algorithm using pseudocode, and a desk check of the solution algorithm using two valid test cases.</p>
<h4>Problem definition</h4>
<ul>
<li>Divide the problem into its three components: <strong>input, output, </strong>and<strong> processing</strong>.&nbsp;</li>
<li>What control structures (sequence, selection and repetition) are required?</li>
<li>What variables are required?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Solution Algorithm using pseudocode</h4>
<p>Having defined the problem and determined the required control structures, devise a solution algorithm and represent it using pseudocode.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Desk Check of your solution</h4>
<p>You need to desk check each of the algorithms with two or more test cases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4></h4>
<h4>1. Create a basic application</h4>
<p>You require an application&nbsp;that will receive an integer from the screen, add 5 to it, double it, subtract 7 from it, and display the final number to the screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>2. Add three numbers and print the total</h4>
<p>A program is required to read three numbers, add them together and print their total.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>3. Find the average temperature</h4>
<p>A program is required to prompt the terminal operator for the maximum and minimum&nbsp;temperature readings on a particular day, accept those readings as integers, and calculate and display to the screen the average temperature, calculated by (maximum&nbsp;temperature + minimum temperature)/2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>4. Compute the mowing time</h4>
<p>A program is required to read from the screen the length and width of a rectangular<br />lawn,and the length and width of the rectangular house that has been built on<br />the lawn. The algorithm should then compute and display the mowing time required to<br />cut the grass around the house, at the rate of two square yards per minute.</p>
<p>Hint: calculate the mowing area in yards and divide by the rate given.</p>
