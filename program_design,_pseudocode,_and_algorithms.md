# Program Design, Pseudocode, and Algorithms

###Objective
* Define the problem by constructing an algorithm using pseudocode
* Create an IPO diagram
* Show a check of your solution with test data for at least two valid test cases
* 
###Problem definition
* Divide the problem into its three components: <strong>input, output, </strong>and<strong> processing</strong>
* What control structures (sequence, selection and repetition) are required?
* What variables are required?


####1. Create a basic application
Your 6 year old client needs an application that will receive an integer from the user banging on the keyboard, add 5 to it, double it, subtract 7 from it, and display the result to the screen.

####2. Add three numbers and print the total
His little sister now wants a program to read three numbers, add them together and print their total.

####3. Find the average score
A program is needed to prompt the user operator for ten exam scores from a class and calculate and display to the screen the average score, calculated as the sum of the scores divided by the number of scores.

####4. Compute the mowing time
A program is required to read from the screen the length and width of a rectangular<br />lawn,and the length and width of the rectangular house that has been built on<br />the lawn. The algorithm should then compute and display the mowing time required to<br />cut the grass around the house, at the rate of two square yards per minute.</p>
<p>Hint: calculate the mowing area in yards and divide by the rate given.</p>
