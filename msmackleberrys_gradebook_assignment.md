###Ms Mackleberry's Gradebook Assignment
Create a new Dynamic Web Application (do not add to an existing project!) that allows one user to enter grades (0-100).

The grades entered should be added to a database table that should look like this:

**Grades Database**

**Field**|**Type**
---|---
Assignment|Varchar
Grade|numeric

 
You will need a page with the form for entering a grade. You will alson need a page to show the grades entered so far. And a page for displaying the current average.

Don't over-think the assignment. Use Bootstrap.
