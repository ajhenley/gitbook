# Ms Mackleberry's Gradebook Assignment

Create a Dynamic Web Application (do not add to an existing project!) that allows one user to enter grades (0-100).

The grades entered should be added to a database table that should look like this:

Grades Database

Field	Type
Assginment	Varchar
Grade	numeric
 

You will need a page with the form for entering a grade, a page to show the grades entered so far, and a page for displaying the current average.

Don't overthink the assignment. Use Bootstrap.
