###Create book database
A book database class will contain a method to return a book object. We haven't exactly learned how to creatae a database yet so we're going to use the knowledge we have to create a class that simulates a database. Later, we'll create a database using Oracle.

Our book database will contain several book titles and the code to look one up.
