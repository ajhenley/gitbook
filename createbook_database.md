###Create book database
A book database class will contain a method to return a book object. We haven't exactly learned how to creatae a database or read/write to files yet. We're going to use the knowledge we have to create a class. Our class will simulate a database and return a populated book object. Later, we'll create a database using Oracle that also returns a book object.

Our book database will contain several book titles and the SKU code to look one up. 

####Your assignment
Create a class that contains a method that takes one parameter, the SKU, and returns a corresponding book object. Your database should contain the following books:

|**SKU**|**Title**|**Author**|**Description**|**Price**|
