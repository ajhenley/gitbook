###Create book database
A book database class will contain a method to return a book object. We haven't exactly learned how to creatae a database or read/write to files yet. We're going to use the knowledge we have to create a class. Our class will simulate a database and return a populated book object. Later, we'll create a database using Oracle that also returns a book object.

Our book database will contain several book titles and the code to look one up.
