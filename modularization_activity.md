# Modularization Activity

<p>For this assignment you will&nbsp;define the problem by constructing a defining diagram, a solution algorithm using pseudocode, and a desk check of the solution algorithm using two valid test cases.</p>
<h4>Problem definition</h4>
<ul>
<li>Divide the problem into its three components: <strong>input, output, </strong>and<strong> processing</strong>.&nbsp;</li>
<li>What control structures (sequence, selection and repetition) are required?</li>
<li>What variables are required?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Solution Algorithm using pseudocode</h4>
<p>Having defined the problem and determined the required control structures, devise a solution algorithm and represent it using pseudocode.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Desk Check of your solution</h4>
<p>You need to desk check each of the algorithms with two or more test cases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>1. Add three numbers and print the total</h4>
