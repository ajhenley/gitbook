Fix this so it prints a picture of my cat:
        System.out.println("  |\_/|");
        System.out.println(" / @ @ \");       
        System.out.println("( > * < )");       
        System.out.println("  >>x<<");      
        System.out.println(" /  O  \");  


        Solution:
        System.out.println("  |\\_/|");
        System.out.println(" / @ @ \\");       
        System.out.println("( > * < )");       
        System.out.println("  >>x<<");      
        System.out.println(" /  O  \\");
