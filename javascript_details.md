###JavaScript Details

   1. **HTML** defines the content of web pages
   2. **CSS** specifies the layout of web pages
   3. **JavaScript** programs the behavior of web pages

JavaScript is a good language but it doesn't follow all the rules that you would expect. For example, if you don't add a semicolon to the end of a statement JavaScript may do it for you causing unexpected results.

Some libraries have evolved to make JavaScript easier for those who don't know all the details of the language. JQuery and Bootstrap make your life easier.

####What can you do with JavaScript
 * Select nodes by tag, id or class
 * Determine if a document has finished loading
 * Change the web page after it has loaded
 * Validate user-entered text before it returns to the server
