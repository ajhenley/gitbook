###JavaScript Details

JavaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:
   1. HTML to define the content of web pages
   2. CSS to specify the layout of web pages
   3. JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages

"JavaScript is the only programming language people attempt to use before they know anything about it". - Douglas Crockford, JavaScript: The Good Parts


* Semicolons after every statement in JavaScript even though they aren't required
* In an HTML document, JavaScript code goes between <script> and </script> tags
* JavaScript code can also be saved in a separate file
* JavaScript code can even be stored on another server 
* You can place any number of scripts in an HTML document.
* Scripts go in the ```<body>``` or the ```<head>``` section of an HTML page (or both)

JavaScript is a good language but it doesn't follow all the rules that you would expect. For example, if you don't add a semicolon to the end of a statement then JavaScript may do it for you. This can cause unexpected results.

For this reason some libraries have evolved to make JavaScript easier to those who don't want to learn all the details of the language. We'll talk about JQuery and Bootstrap. They will both make your life easier.

 Some things you can do with JavaScript
 * Select nodes by tag, id or class
 * Determine if a document has finished loading
 * Change the web page after it has loaded
 * Validate user-entered text before it returns to the server
