# First JavaScript Assignment
<p><span>JavaScript and Java are completely different languages, both in concept and design.</span><br /><span>JavaScript was invented in 1995, and became a standard in 1997.</span></p>
<p>The Java platform and language began as an internal project at Sun Microsystems in December 1990, providing an alternative to the C++/C programming languages.</p>
<p>JavaScript is a popular programming language that's built into all the major web browsers and used to make web pages interactive.</p>
<h3>Create your first script</h3>
<p>Create a script that simply says Hello, World! when the user clicks a button.</p>
<p>Your script looks like this and can go in between the &lt;head&gt; and &lt;/head&gt; tags of your web page.</p>
<p>The script starts with an html comment to hide it from browsers with JavaScript disabled.</p>
<pre>&lt;script language="JavaScript"&gt;<br />&lt;!--
function Hello()<br /> {<br /> alert("Hello World!")<br /> }//--&gt;<br />&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Place the script between the &lt;head&gt; tags of your web page and modify your body tag as follows to call the function when the page loads. Then, save your project and refresh your page.</p>
<pre>&lt;body onload="<span>Hello</span>()"&gt;</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
