###Looping Database Servlet Assignment
1. Create a new Dynamic Web Application. 
2. Add a servlet that will output all the customers in the DemoCustomer table. If you don't have a DemoCustomer table then loop through whatever table you used in the Java Oracle assignment.
3. This time use Bootstrap to make the table look nice.
