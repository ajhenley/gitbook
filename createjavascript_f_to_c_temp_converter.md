###Create JavaScript F to C Temp converter

Create a single page web-application to convert temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius and from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

Show an appropriate image from google images or whatever source you can find to go with the selected temperature. For example, if the temperature is below freezing then display a coat or a snowflake or something. You'll modify your image tag as follows:

```html
<img src="http://www.somesite.com/snowflake.jpg" height="150" width="150"/>
````

#####The formula is:


> &deg;C = (&deg;F - 32) &times; 5/9
> 
> &deg;F = &deg;C &times; 9/5 + 32
