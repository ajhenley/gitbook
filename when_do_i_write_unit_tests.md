# When do I write unit tests?

Don't wait until you've developed all your code to begin writing your unit tests. Written tests give you a goal. Write the tests as soon as you realize that you will need them and develop your program to pass the test. Make it a point to try to write tests that will fail. Challenge yourself. You'll have more fun programming and at the same time you'll remain more focused and motivated.

###Writing good unit tests
Your tests should
 * Have descriptive names that let you know what broke just by reading the name.
 * Test one and only one thing 
 * Run quickly. If your tests take too long to run you won't run them.
 * Be resilient to change
 * Logically map to the classes you're testing
