# When do I write unit tests?

Don't wait until you've developed all your code to begin writing your unit tests. Written tests give you a goal. Write the tests as soon as you realize that you will need them and develop your program to pass the test. Make it a point to try to write tests that will fail. Challenge yourself. You'll have more fun programming and at the same time you'll remain more focused and motivated.
